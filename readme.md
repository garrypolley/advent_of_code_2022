# 2022 Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/2022/

So far fun, kind of like coding katas.

## Day one

```python
# Problem 1
In [2]: from count_calories_by_elf import *
In [11]: largest_elf['sum']
Out[11]: 69177

# Problem 2
In [2]: from count_calories_by_elf import *
In [6]:  stuff = order_elves_by_most_calories(all_elves)
In [9]: stuff[0][1]['sum'] + stuff[1][1]['sum'] + stuff[2][1]['sum']
Out[9]: 207456
```
